# Coursera_Capstone
Capstone of Applied Data Science Specialization offered by IBM on Coursera

## Battle of the neighborhoods
This capstone course will consist of five modules. In the first three modules, I hope to equip you with all the additional skills you need so that in the remaining two modules you will be able to work on something exciting of your own creativity. You will be required to leverage location data to solve a problem or to get deeper insights into a neighborhood's reputation.
